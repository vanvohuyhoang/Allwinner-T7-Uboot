Compile:
make distclean
make sun8iw17p1_config
make -j4 #If the computer configuration is insufficient, such as using a notebook, it is recommended not to use the "-j32" parameter
After compiling alone, go back to the lichee directory to execute ./build.sh and then ./build.sh pack, and the updated uboot will be compiled into a new package.
